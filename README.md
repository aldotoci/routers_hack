This is was a fun little project and vulnerability that I found On my ISP router.
I could access all of the home user routers of my ISP and see their wifi password.
This was possible since they did not have a firewall to block requests from my router
to the other routers of the network(VPN).
This script manages to brute-force and find all IPs of every router and I could open their router settings 
and login with the default username and password, admin:amdin.
At the time of speaking this is patched!
